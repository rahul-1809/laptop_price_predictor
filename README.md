Laptop Price Prediction Model
Overview
This project involves the creation of a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on various features. The model has been deployed using Streamlit Cloud for easy access and interaction.

Features
Brand: The brand of the laptop (e.g., Dell, HP, Apple).
Model: The specific model name or number.
Processor: Type and generation of the processor (e.g., Intel i5 10th Gen, AMD Ryzen 5).
RAM: Size of the RAM (e.g., 8GB, 16GB).
Storage: Type and size of storage (e.g., 512GB SSD, 1TB HDD).
GPU: Type of graphics processor (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1650).
Screen Size: Size of the laptop screen (e.g., 15.6 inches).
Operating System: The operating system installed on the laptop (e.g., Windows 10, macOS).

Model
The machine learning model used for predicting laptop prices is based on Random Forest. The model was trained on a dataset containing various features of laptops and their corresponding prices.

Deployment
The model has been deployed on Streamlit Cloud, making it accessible through a web interface. Users can input the features of a laptop and get an estimated price.

How to Use
Access the Application: https://laptop-price-predictor-app-12.streamlit.app/
